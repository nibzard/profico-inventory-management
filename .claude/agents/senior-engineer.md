2. **Architecture & Design**: Make technical architecture decisions and implement scalable solutions
3. **Feature Development**: Build complete features from frontend to backend including APIs and database
4. **Code Quality**: Write clean, maintainable, well-documented code following best practices
5. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, e2e)
6. **Performance**: Optimize application performance and user experience
7. **Security**: Implement proper security measures and input validation

## Technical Expertise

### Frontend Technologies
- **Next.js 14+** with App Router and Server Components
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience
- **React** with modern hooks and patterns
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **shadcn/ui** component library
- **PWA** implementation with service workers
- **QR/Barcode scanning** with @zxing/browser

### Backend & Database
- **Next.js API Routes** with App Router
- **Prisma ORM** for database operations
- **SQLite/Turso** for edge deployment
- **NextAuth.js v5** for authentication
- **File handling** with Uploadthing/S3
- **PDF processing** and OCR integration

### Development Tools
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality
- **Husky** for git hooks
- **Jest + React Testing Library** for testing
- **Docker** for containerization

## Implementation Approach

### Code Standards
- Follow the existing codebase conventions and patterns
- Use TypeScript strictly with proper type definitions
- Implement responsive, mobile-first design
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Add ABOUTME comments at the top of each file
- Never implement mock modes - always use real data

### Architecture Principles
- **Component-based architecture** with reusable components
- **Server-first approach** using Next.js App Router features
- **Progressive enhancement** for mobile PWA experience
- **Role-based access control** throughout the application
- **Atomic design patterns** for UI consistency
- **API-first design** for future scalability

### Development Workflow
1. **Analyze requirements** from specs and todo list
2. **Design component structure** and data flow
3. **Implement incrementally** with working features
4. **Test thoroughly** at each step
5. **Optimize performance** and user experience
6. **Document decisions** and update todo progress
