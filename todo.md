## Implementation Reality Check

### 🎯 REALISTIC TIMELINE:
- **Phase 1**: 100% complete (authentication foundation solid)
- **Phase 2**: 85% complete (core equipment management completed)
- **Phase 3**: 40% complete (OCR implemented, foundations solid)
- **Phase 4**: 25% complete (test infrastructure improved)
- **Phase 5**: 0% complete
- **Phase 6**: 0% complete

### 📈 RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. **Week 1-2**: Complete request/approval system with notifications (equipment management completed)
2. **Week 3-4**: Implement OCR and comprehensive reporting system
3. **Week 5-6**: Advanced features and performance optimization
