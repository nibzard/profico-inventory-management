# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ProfiCo Inventory Management System - A comprehensive inventory management solution for tracking hardware equipment and software subscriptions with role-based access, approval workflows, and compliance reporting.

**Current Status**: Next.js application initialized with App Router. Prisma schema implemented with comprehensive data models including NextAuth.js integration. Basic project structure established with shadcn/ui components.

## Architecture & Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes with Server Actions
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM (Turso for production)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v5 with role-based access control
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives (installed)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with class-variance-authority
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Role-Based System Architecture

### User Roles
- **Regular User**: Personal equipment view, request equipment, report issues
- **Team Lead/Manager**: Team equipment view, approve requests, assign equipment
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, reports, configuration

### Core Domain Models

The Prisma schema includes comprehensive models for the inventory system:

**Core Business Models:**
- **User**: Role-based system (admin/team_lead/user) with NextAuth.js integration
- **Team**: Team organization with leader assignments
- **Equipment**: Full lifecycle management with status tracking, ownership history
- **EquipmentRequest**: Multi-level approval workflows with justification
- **EquipmentHistory**: Complete audit trail for equipment transfers
- **Subscription**: Software license management with billing cycles
- **MaintenanceRecord**: Equipment maintenance tracking
- **InventoryCheck**: Annual verification workflows
- **SmallInventoryItem**: Quantity-based tracking for consumables

**Authentication Models (NextAuth.js):**
- **Account**: OAuth provider accounts
- **Session**: User sessions
- **VerificationToken**: Email verification tokens

**Key Relationships:**
- Users can own equipment, make requests, and have approval authority
- Equipment has complete history tracking and maintenance records
- Teams have leaders who can approve requests from team members

## Development Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server with Turbopack
npm run build        # Build for production with Turbopack
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix     # Run ESLint with auto-fix
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check # Check code formatting
npm run typecheck    # Run TypeScript checks
```

### Database Operations
```bash
npm run db:generate  # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:push      # Push schema to database
npm run db:studio    # Open Prisma Studio
npm run db:seed      # Run database seed script
npx prisma migrate dev  # Create and apply migration (not aliased)
```

### Code Quality
```bash
npx lint-staged      # Run pre-commit hooks (ESLint + Prettier)
npm run prepare      # Setup Husky git hooks
```

**Note**: Testing framework not yet configured. Will be added in Phase 2.

## Key Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Partially Complete)
- âœ… Project initialization with Next.js 15+ and TypeScript
- âœ… Database schema design with Prisma (comprehensive models)
- âœ… Basic project structure with App Router
- âœ… shadcn/ui components foundation
- ðŸ”„ Authentication setup with NextAuth.js v5 (schema ready)
- ðŸ”„ Basic UI components implementation

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Equipment CRUD operations with lifecycle management
- QR code generation and scanning
- Request/approval workflows
- User dashboard interfaces

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- PWA implementation with offline capabilities
- Reporting and analytics
- File upload and OCR processing
- Software subscription management

## Specialized Subagents

This project includes three custom subagents for specific workflows:

- **todo-agent**: Maintains project todo.md file and progress tracking
- **git-master**: Handles git operations with conventional commits
- **senior-engineer**: Implements all technical features and development tasks

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- NEVER use --no-verify flag
- Pre-commit hooks must pass before committing
- Feature branches: feature/, fix/, docs/, refactor/

### Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Components start with ABOUTME comments
- Mobile-first responsive design
- No mock implementations - always use real data
- Follow existing codebase patterns

## Project Files

### Documentation
- `SPECS.md`: Complete product requirements document (278 lines)
- `TECH-STACK.md`: Technology stack decisions and deployment options
- `todo.md`: Detailed development roadmap with 80+ tasks across 6 phases

### Configuration
- `.claude/agents/`: Custom subagents for specialized workflows
- `.claude/settings.local.json`: Permitted bash operations
- `.gitignore`: Next.js project exclusions

## Equipment Management Features

### Equipment Lifecycle
- Status flow: pending â†’ available â†’ assigned â†’ maintenance/broken â†’ decommissioned
- Complete ownership history tracking
- QR code labels for physical tracking
- Bulk operations for inventory management

### Request System
- Multi-level approval chains (User â†’ Team Lead â†’ Admin)
- Equipment justification requirements
- Status tracking with email notifications
- Audit trail for compliance

### Small Inventory Items
- Quantity-based tracking for items under â‚¬150
- Minimum stock level alerts
- Simplified request workflows

## Integration Points

### External Services
- **Turso**: Edge database deployment
- **Uploadthing/S3**: File storage for invoices and photos
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro**: OCR for invoice processing
- **PostHog**: Product analytics (Phase 3)

### Compliance Requirements
- 2-year depreciation cycle tracking
- Purchase method classification (ProfiCo, ZOPI, Leasing, Off-the-shelf)
- Annual inventory verification workflows
- Accounting system export capabilities

## Next Steps

The immediate development priorities are outlined in todo.md:
1. âœ… Next.js project initialization
2. âœ… Prisma database schema implementation
3. ðŸ”„ NextAuth.js authentication configuration
4. ðŸ”„ Basic UI components and layouts
5. ðŸ”„ Equipment management features

Refer to todo.md for the complete 6-phase development roadmap with detailed task breakdowns and priority levels.
- Everytime before starting any work use task master sub agent to check todo.md and understand what was done and what should we work on next.
